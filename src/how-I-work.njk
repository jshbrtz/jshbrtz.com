	<h2>Principles to shipping valuable work</h2>
	<p></p>
	<h3>1. Finding the right problems requires listening</h3>
	<p>Understanding our clients and customers is the bedrock of my practice. Impartial research empowers us to ship the best outcomes. It helps us frame what we're looking for in feedback and challenges us to remain impartial to our work.</p>
	<h3>2. Internal partnerships are a must</h3>
	<p><em>Everyone can be a subject matter expert.</em> I take pride in my reputation of partnering with Engineers, QA Testers, Product Managers and Owners, Product Marketing, and front-lines staff working at every touchpoint of the customer journey. I open the door to feedback from all corners.</p>
	<h3>3. The process must be adaptable</h3>
	<p>Each project has different requirements. One may require extensive research and deliverables, another may not have an accommodating deadline. My aim is not to etch our process in stone, but to adapt my approach to the needs of the project and our delivery teams. And most importantly: we iterate, iterate, iterate.</p>

	<p>However, my work is used on millions of devices all over the globe <em>and</em> the <a href="https://twitter.com/jamfsoftware/status/778617416209272833">International Space Station</a> &mdash; literally out of this world. I've taken feedback and delivered on it for some amazing organizations, including:</p>

If you're looking for someone that is smart, knows the craft of user experience and design, while still being humble and able to work with a wide swath of others with different backgrounds then look no further.

He has a keen eye for design and user experience, and will always go the extra mile to do what's right for the customer/user.

The feedback he delivers is always well thought-through, clearly communicated, regularly backed by data, always given with the best interest of the user or customer at the forefront, and always greatly appreciated.</p>
