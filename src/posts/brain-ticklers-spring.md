It's officially warm out. North Carolina's growing season started more than two months sooner than Minnesota, but we're here for it. Winter is a time to shed old skin, to look out at the world and collect yourself, and plan.

It can get exhausting though, so it's important to take some time for things that tickle your brain. My top five for the season:

<ul class="no-list-decor">
	<li>📚&nbsp;&nbsp;Cal Flyn's hopeful <a href="https://www.calflyn.com/nonfiction-books/islands-of-abandonment-nature-rebounding-post-human-landscape">Islands of Abandonment</a>, on natural biomes appearing in post-human landscapes</li>
	<li>🍱&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://lifeandthyme.com">Life & Thyme's</a> illuminating journalism on the politics of food</li>
	<li>📸&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas Murphy's <a href="https://therealmurphy.substack.com">Blood & Champagne</a>, a weekly palate cleanser compendium for the brain</li>
	<li>🐪&nbsp;&nbsp;The weird and marvelous <a href="https://vimeo.com/407941034">Bactrian camel</a> finally getting the love letter it deserves</li>
	<li>🐝&nbsp;&nbsp;A <a href="https://www.dwell.com/article/tecla-3d-printed-home-mario-cucinella-architects-wasp-28cde493">3D-printed concrete home</a> inspired by wasp nests, in Bologna, Italy</li>
</ul>

If you're not following along with my <a href="./playlists">seasonal playlists</a>, it's my collection of songs that I keep replaying. Sent to me by friends, pulled from the charts, and maybe some deep cuts. They mark time, or a moment, or trigger a memory -- you know how music works. Listen to _2022 spring_ on <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/2022-spring/pl.u-LRdYmsBA2KX">Apple Music</a>
