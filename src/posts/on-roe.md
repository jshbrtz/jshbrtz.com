In 2020, in the wake of George Floyd's murder by Derek Chauvin, I watched my then-employer's CEO deliver an "all lives matter" statement internally, his thinking being that it was a level-setting phrase, so as to not take sides one way or another. The opening keynote video at our customer conference that year used the rubble on the street in my own neighborhood as his backdrop. Racism lives through willful ignorance.

In a meeting on January 6th, 2021, I was told that I can watch the insurrection on YouTube later. The meeting &#8212; the business &#8212; was more important.

I left the job several months later. I made it clear that any organization that prioritizes social impact solely for revenue contributes to the problem.

This month, under the guise of religious righteousness, five people in our highest court have determined that the women of the United States are no longer entitled to their own life story, that they do not deserve the kinds of protections and autonomy afforded to men.

This same company's same CEO attempted to silence the anguish on Slack with an "all sides matter" stance. He issued a mandate to managers to police and silence the discussions around it to prevent what he saw as bullying. Silencing and subjugating women for their justifiable anger.

In the coming months, we will see headlines about women sent to prison, "caught" in attempt to abort a pregnancy conceived through rape. Abusive men are more emboldened than ever. They carry with them a biological weapon to inflict the harshest suffering on their spouses and partners.

Design is political. Business is political. Our decisions can have ramifications for generations. We see it with the impact of unregulated social media, the push to drive up numbers on engagement metrics. Global warming is caused by the poor choices of businesses, their metrics, and the hubris of their design practice.

Design also has the immense power to change the world for the better. We have the most powerful tools in human history in our pockets to connect people and point them to the resources they need. To take a stance for human rights and the sanctity of the individual. This is the stance that I take.

### Let's change things
If you and your organization are working to bring tools to the world that help women seek safe passage to safe reproductive care, access to safe housing if the nearest provider is too far, I want to help. The Court has forced a tremendous burden on women, but we in Tech and Design have an ethical and moral responsibility to ease that as much as possible.
