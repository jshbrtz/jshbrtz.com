					<h3 class="subheading">Jamf Now</h3>
					<p>A cloud-based SaaS Apple device management platform for small business. More than <a href="https://www.imore.com/jamf-now-manages-20-million-apple-devices-around-world" target="_blank">20 million devices</a> are managed through Jamf &mdash; almost 500,000 of those are on <a href="https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-now/" target="_blank">Jamf Now</a>.</p>
					
					<p>We offer Standard and Plus subscriptions, leveraging Plus as a set of entirely optional advanced features, which helps us avoid unnecessary upselling.</p>

					<h3 class="subheading">The user</h3>
					<p>We've established five user personas at Jamf, spanning every level of technical proficiency, from the basics of using a Mac, to writing custom apps and building out company networks. Jamf Now is the <strong>only product at Jamf</strong> with all five personas represented in its base.</p>
					
					<p>The majority of our customers manage devices as a <strong>secondary or tertiary responsibility</strong>.</p>
					
					<h3 class="subheading">My role</h3>
					<p>As the designer for Jamf Now, my primary goal is to create consistent, reusable patterns, workflows, and improvements toward the quality of life across the entire platform.</p>
					
					<p>We put a huge effort into ensuring that anyone can feel confident with our product, regardless of technical proficiency.</p>

				<div class="double-column">
					<h3 class="subheading">Constrained UI</h3>
					<p>We needed to integrate new functionality into a workflow that administrators use to assign apps to devices. The thing is, this workflow was already stretched to its limits.</p>

					<h3 class="subheading">No space</h3>
					<p>Literally. We ran out of space on desktop, and the mobile experience was so overcrowded that it became practically unusable. We had to come up with a new, better experience, and fast. Our engineers had a two-week window to fit this in before they had to move on.</p>
					
					<h3 class="subheading">Not enough visual feedback</h3>
					<p>There were no cues as to which apps in the list were just added versus apps that had already been in the Blueprint.</p>

					<h3 class="subheading">No time!</h3>
					<p>Without time for an external usability study, we used lean methods to gather internal feedback from our customer-facing teams.</p>

				<div class="double-column">
					<p>I partnered with Ryan Rud, one of our UI Engineers, to work on an idea we had add and modify apps without modals. We jumped into Zoom calls, exchanged annotated mockups on Slack, and pulled in the other UI Engineers, Product Owners, Product Managers, fellow UX Designers, and our Jamf Now Customer Success and Support teams for feedback throughout.</p>

					<p>The result was a workflow that everyone agreed was a pound-for-pound improvement over the existing. And we had plenty of time left to write up thorough design documentation for handoff.</p>
