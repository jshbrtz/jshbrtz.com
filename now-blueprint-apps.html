More than <a href="https://www.imore.com/jamf-now-manages-20-million-apple-devices-around-world" target="_blank">20 million devices</a> are managed on Jamf Now.</p>

					<p>A significant number of our customers manage devices as a secondary or tertiary responsibility, so our job is to ensure that anyone, regardless of technical proficiency, feels confident.</p>

					<p>Our UX team uses five personas spanning all the levels of proficiency and responsibility we've come to know from our users.</p>

				<div class="double-column">
					<ul>
						<li>When adding an app, users are given overlapping interfaces with competing similarities.</li>
						<li>Modals on Jamf Now are not designed with mobile in mind. Content is pushed out of frame quickly, even on the largest portable screens</li>
						<li>We were dealing with a cramped interface. We needed to create breathing room for extensibility.</li>
						<li>The solution needed to provide power and flexibility for beginner and advanced users, Standard tier and Plus tier users. One-size-fits-all.</li>
						<li>We needed to come up with something fast. The Product Owner and I agreed that this could ship ahead of those upcoming roadmap features, but we had a short window before Engineering was unavailable.</li>
