					<p>A significant number of our customers manage devices as a secondary or tertiary responsibility, so we focus on ensuring that anyone feels confident with our product, regardless of technical proficiency.</p>

					<p>We needed to integrate new functionality into a workflow that administrators use to assign apps to devices. The thing is, this workflow was already stretched to its limits.</p>

					<p>Literally. We ran out of space on desktop, and the mobile experience was so overcrowded that it became practically unusable. We had to come up with a new, better experience, and fast. Our engineers had a two-week window to fit this in before they had to move on.</p>

					<p>Without time for an external usability study, we used lean methods to gather internal feedback from our customer-facing teams.</p>

					<p>I partnered with Ryan Rud, one of our UI Engineers, to work on an idea we had add and modify apps without modals. We jumped into Zoom calls, exchanged annotated mockups on Slack, and pulled in the other UI Engineers, Product Owners, Product Managers, fellow UX Designers, and our Jamf Now Customer Success and Support teams for feedback throughout.</p>

					<p>The result was a workflow that everyone agreed was a pound-for-pound improvement over the existing. And we had plenty of time left to write up thorough design documentation for handoff.</p>
