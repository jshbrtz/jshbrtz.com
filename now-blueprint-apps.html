					<p>A significant number of our customers manage devices as a secondary or tertiary responsibility, so our job is to ensure that anyone, regardless of technical proficiency, feels confident.</p>

					<p>Our UX team uses five personas spanning all the levels of proficiency and responsibility we've come to know from our users.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="double-column">
					<p>We needed to integrate new functionality into a workflow that administrators use to assign apps to devices. The thing is, this workflow was already stretched to its limits.</p>
						
					<p>Literally. We ran out of space on desktop, and the mobile experience was so overcrowded that it was unusable. We had to come up with a new, better experience, and fast. Our engineers had a two-week window to fit this in before they had to move on.</p>
					
					<p>Without time for an external usability study, we used lean methods to gather internal feedback from our customer-facing teams.</p>
