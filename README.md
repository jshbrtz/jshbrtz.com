Here lies the code for my public site, an ever-changing, goalpost-moving product of idle hands. I am learning as I go and happy to hear from anyone looking about what I can improve.

## Fun facts
* This site runs on the latest version of @11ty/eleventy (1.0.1 as of writing)
* Run `ELEVENTY_ENV=dev eleventy --serve` to give yourself a snazzy little developer-mode-only favicon
* `markdown-it` is installed to allow me to put HTML directly in my Markdown files
