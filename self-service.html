					<h3 class="subheading">Jamf Now</h3>
					<p>A cloud-based SaaS Apple device management platform for small business. More than <a href="https://www.imore.com/jamf-now-manages-20-million-apple-devices-around-world" target="_blank">20 million devices</a> are managed through Jamf &mdash; almost 500,000 of those are on <a href="https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-now/" target="_blank">Jamf Now</a>.</p>
					
					<p>We offer Standard and Plus subscriptions, leveraging Plus as a set of entirely optional advanced features, intended to avoid unnecessary upselling.</p>

					<h3 class="subheading">User</h3>
					<p>UX at Jamf has established five user personas, spanning every level of technical proficiency, from the basics of using a Mac, to writing custom apps and building out company networks. Jamf Now is the <strong>only product at Jamf</strong> with all five personas represented in its user base.</p>
					
					<p>The majority of Jamf Now's customers manage devices as a <strong>secondary or tertiary responsibility</strong>.</p>
					
					<h3 class="subheading">My role</h3>
					<p>As the UX designer for Jamf Now, my primary goal is advocating for and co-creating <strong>experience-driven roadmaps and strategies</strong>. I aim to design consistent, reusable patterns, workflows, and improvements toward the quality of life across the platform. We accomplish this with constant cross-team, cross-discipline collaboration and a culture of open, candid feedback.</p>
					
					<p>We put a ton of focus on empowering anyone, regardless of technical proficiency, to feel confident with the product.</p>

					<h3 class="subheading">Thinking ahead</h3>
					<p>There is only one decision to make today when deploying apps on Jamf Now -- install to all compatible devices, or don't install at all. A new, major roadmap initiative came with a new, major deployment option that would allow our admins to offer apps to their co-workers as a choice, but our existing UI wasn't having it.</p>

					<h3 class="subheading">No room</h3>
					<p>Literally. The existing desktop UI couldn't handle the addition of a second deployment option <strong>[fig.1]</strong>. It was too much visual noise in an overburdened modal. And our long-neglected mobile experience was already practically unusable <strong>[fig.2]</strong>. In order to add this per-app option, we realized that we needed to rethink the entire workflow.</p>

					<h3 class="subheading">No time</h3>
					<p>Ryan and I had a two-week window to get this done. Without time for a usability study, we treated my mockups as digital paper prototypes to gather internal feedback from our customer-facing teams and Product stakeholders through Lean design practices.</p>

					<figcaption><strong>[fig.1]</strong> The modal portrayed the action of adding from a different list, but there were no visual cues to see which apps you just added. We also literally boxed ourselves in, making adding functionality very challenging.</figcaption>

				<div class="double-column">
					<p>I partnered with Ryan Rud, one of our UI Engineers, to work on an idea we had add and modify apps without modals. We jumped into Zoom calls, exchanged annotated mockups on Slack, and pulled in the other UI Engineers, Product Owners, Product Managers, fellow UX Designers, and our Jamf Now Customer Success and Support teams for feedback throughout.</p>

					<p>The result was a workflow that everyone agreed was a pound-for-pound improvement over the existing. And we had plenty of time left to write up thorough design documentation for handoff.</p>
